        The <a href="#"><em>Farseer</em> trilogy</a> is a series of <a href="#">fantasy</a> novels by American author <a href="#">Robin Hobb</a> <em>(pictured)</em>. Set in and around the fictional realm of the Six Duchies, it tells the story of FitzChivalry Farseer (known as Fitz), an illegitimate son of a prince. Fitz is trained as an assassin and possesses two forms of magic: the telepathic Skill that runs in the royal line, and the socially despised Wit that enables a bond between Fitz and the wolf Nighteyes. Through her portrayal of the Wit, Hobb examines <a href="#">otherness</a> and ecological themes. Societal prejudice against the ability exposes Fitz to persecution and shame, and he leads a <a href="#">closeted</a> life as a Wit user, which scholars see as an allegory for <a href="#">queerness</a>. The series follows his life as he seeks to restore stability to the kingdom. Published between 1995 and 1997, the Farseer trilogy was Margaret Astrid Lindholm Ogden's first work under the <a href="#">pen name</a> Robin Hobb. It met with critical and commercial success, and led to <a href="#">several other series</a> in the same setting. (<a href="#"><strong>Full article...</strong></a>)
